Tired of fake web2 social networks? introducing: ivy live!

one of the biggest problems in today's social media is the prevalence of misinformation and fake news that spreads on these platforms. social media can cause misinformation and fake news to spread quickly due to the fast-paced nature of news dissemination and sharing. this can lead people to be misled by incorrect information and even make wrong decisions.

another issue is that social media can threaten people's privacy. In particular, there can be serious problems with the sharing of personal information and privacy violations. social media platforms can sometimes collect users' personal information without their consent or share it with third parties. this violates personal privacy rights.

furthermore, it can be said that social media presents a problem with time management. social media users may not be able to devote enough time to other tasks due to the long periods they spend on these platforms. this can negatively affect their job and school performance.

finally, the spread of destructive, harassing, and hate-filled messages among people due to the misuse of social media has become another important issue. such behavior can have a negative impact on people's psychological health and social harmony.

all these problems are solved with the presentable environment offered by ivy live.

we built our social media interactions not on exhibitionism and popularism, but on reality. you may not know who all the people you interact with will actually be. any user may not reveal their real name and surname. but the truth is that he cannot join this platform without using his real knowledge. so it cannot be hidden behind forgery. and cannot create manipulation with more than one account. moreover, users are warned if they make insults, swear words, etc. If it continues, your account will be banned forever. likewise, sharing pornographic, terrorism, etc. causes users to be warned first and then completely restricted. against these rules, users have 2 options. either opt-out or inability to use this platform. in both cases, all other users can use their social networks with pleasure and peace of mind.

while ivy live offers this presentable environment, it does not deprive users of any of the other social media features they are used to. offers more.
